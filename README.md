# DearLearning

Project idea: use Deep Learning to ear the difference between instruments

## Setup

Developed with Python 3.7 and should be compatible with Python 3.6+

Developed on macOS and Ubuntu. Not sure about compatibility with other systems

Install the requirements with the usual:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

You should be able to play with:

```sh
./src/main.py
```

You may have to run `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` beforehand for the imports to work.
